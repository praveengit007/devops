This is to practice by creating a task branch.
This is a task named file.
:wq
Now i need to pull and merge this file to local.


i am goin to re-practice the session of creating a file and branch then push them to remote and pull them back to main branch and delete other branches in local as well as remote.
Now i am goin for pull request and delete the 'develop' branch.
